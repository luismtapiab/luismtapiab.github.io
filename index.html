  <p>
    I'm a developer and musician from Bolivia, this page contains some of the projects I did.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm interested in solving problems with the tools I know, more about the
    logic and taking apart the pieces rather the languages or software but I
    enjoy both.
    <br>
    I'm a developer but in my personal life I'm also a caretaker, proud guardian of two dogs.
    I also like to travel and explore new places.
